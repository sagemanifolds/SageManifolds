\chapter*{Preface}
These notes correspond to two lectures\footnote{The slides, demo
notebooks and videos of the lectures are available at \url{http://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/jncf2018/}.} given by one of us (EG)
at \emph{Journées Nationales de Calcul Formel 2018}  (French Computer Algebra Days),
which took place at Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques (CIRM),
in Marseille, France, on 22-26 January 2018.

EG warmly thanks Marc Mezzarobba and the organizers of JNCF 2018 for their
invitation and the perfect organization of the lectures. He also acknowledges
the nice hospitality of CIRM staff and many fruitful exchanges with the JNCF~2018
participants.
